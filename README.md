Abstract
--------

The main aim of this thesis is to make realistic predictions and to
investigate the sources of uncertainties in the observables of nonaccreting
cold neutron stars and warm protoneutron stars, using the present day 
constraints provided by nuclear experiments, developments in chiral 
effective field theory, and astrophysical observations.
A unified metamodeling approach was introduced to calculate the stellar 
composition and equation of state of cold nonaccreting neutron stars for any 
functional of nuclear matter.
A Bayesian determination of the equation of state parameters was carried out,
leading to realistic predictions for neutron star observables.
At finite temperature, a full statistical equilibrium of ions in the crust was 
considered, allowing in particular for the computation of the impurity 
parameter.
The results are compatible with constraints inferred from GW170817, and
suggest that a full crustal origin of pulsar glitches should be excluded. 
Deviations in the crust composition from cold catalyzed matter are 
observed at the crystallization temperature. 
Results show that the contribution of impurities is nonnegligible, 
thus potentially having an impact on transport properties in the crust.
Higher precision in the determination of high-order isovector
empirical parameters through nuclear experiments or low-density effective field 
theory predictions, and in the experimental and/or theoretical knowledge of the 
surface energy at extreme isospin ratios are needed to reduce the uncertainties 
of crustal observables. 
The numerical framework developed during this thesis can be used as a basis for 
future studies.
