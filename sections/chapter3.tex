\chapter{Crystallization of the crust of a non-accreting neutron star}

\section{Model of the crust at finite temperature}

% in this study, no proton drip nor pasta phases are considered in the
%   free neutron regime. one can assume that proton drip does not occur in the
%   range of temperature considered here. Pasta phases are difficult to account
%   for within the mcp treatment

\subsection{One-component Coulomb plasma approximation}

% in this subsection we give the main assumptions for the ocp treatment at
% finite temperature

% Let us notice that in the regime of the outer crust, no outside neutron gas 
%   is considered, thus Fg = 0

\begin{equation}
  F = F_i + F_g + F_e
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  F_i = M^\star c^2 + F_i^{\text{id}} + F_i^{\text{int}}
\end{equation}

% the following subsubsection explain in details which corrections into the
%   interacting part of the energy and the ideal one, depending on the the
%   phase of matter, either solid or liquid.
